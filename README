The term "panoptic" refers to the fact that panoptic segmentation combines two types of segmentation: semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. In semantic segmentation, the goal is to label each pixel with a class label (e.g., car, person, tree). In instance segmentation, the goal is to label each pixel with an instance ID (e.g., car1, car2, person1, person2).

Panoptic segmentation was introduced in 2019 by Kirillov et al. in the paper "Panoptic Segmentation". The paper proposes a unified framework for panoptic segmentation, which combines a semantic segmentation network with an instance segmentation network.
